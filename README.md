# ðŸš§ RoadInjuryAI

> A machine learning project to predict the severity of road accidents based on multiple accident-related factors.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This project aims to build predictive models that estimate the **severity of a road traffic accident** (e.g. light, serious, fatal) using various accident-related attributes such as weather, location, time, vehicle, and victim characteristics.

The goal is to support road safety initiatives by identifying risk factors and helping to prevent severe injuries.

## ðŸ§ª Technologies

- [**Python 3.10+**](https://www.python.org/) â€“ General-purpose programming language used throughout the project
- [**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) / [**NumPy**](https://numpy.org/) â€“ For data manipulation and analysis
- [**Scikit-learn**](https://scikit-learn.org/) â€“ For baseline machine learning models like Random Forest
- [**XGBoost**](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/) â€“ For high-performance gradient boosting classification
- [**Streamlit**](https://streamlit.io/) â€“ For creating interactive visual dashboards to explore model results

## ðŸš¦ Roadmap

- [x] Create project skeleton
- [x] Load and explore accident dataset
- [x] Train Random Forest & XGBoost models
- [x] Evaluate & compare results
- [x] Display result in streamlit dashboard
- [ ] Deploy interactive dashboard via Streamlit
