# ðŸš§ RoadInjuryAI

> A machine learning project to predict the severity of road accidents based on multiple accident-related factors.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This project aims to build predictive models that estimate the **severity of a road traffic accident** (e.g. light, serious, fatal) using various accident-related attributes such as weather, location, time, vehicle, and victim characteristics.

The goal is to support road safety initiatives by identifying risk factors and helping to prevent severe injuries.

## ðŸ§ª Technologies

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for baseline models (Random Forest)
- **XGBoost** for advanced gradient boosting classification
- **Streamlit** for interactive dashboards and visual comparisons

## ðŸš¦ Roadmap

- [x] Create project skeleton
- [ ] Load and explore accident dataset
- [ ] Train Random Forest & XGBoost models
- [ ] Evaluate & compare results
- [ ] Deploy interactive dashboard via Streamlit
